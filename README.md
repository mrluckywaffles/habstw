Simple static website that tells if you this week's episode of Kill la Kill has been subbed and released.

Checks the HorribleSubs and Underwater RSS feed for anything named Kill la Kill uploaded since last Monday. If it detects something, it will display a message and provide related links.

It also plays music for some reason?!?

TODO:

- make sure i didnt break qa with all my github edits
- beg someone to make a transparent catsuki.png
  - then come up with something to do w/ it
- cleanup (make class either hyphen or camel, make modules _ or not, etc)
- extract refresh logic into a module
